# Getting started with Strapi

Strapi offers a lot of flexibility, its come with full [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds. The CLI works with both the yarn and npm package managers.

# strapi develop

Strapi modifies/creates files at runtime and needs to restart when new files are created. To achieve this, strapi develop adds a file watcher and restarts the application when necessary.

# or
npm run strapi develop
```

# strapi start

```
